Analysts: Sarah Zachrich, Meg Estey, Thampi Mathews, Robin Bun, Jennie Brozena

Data Type: Geologic Earthquake Data
Data Source: USGS Earthquake Hazards Program Site

# Project Scope
We will be looking at earthquake data on a global scale for the previous year (2019) to better understand where earthquakes occur most often on Earth along with some other variables we want to visualize. We will answer any related questions as the data admits.

# Target Questions
Is there a certain time of years earthquakes occur more often or more strongly? 
Where are earthquakes most common? 
Where are the biggest earthquakes occurring (& would you be able to feel them)? 
Does earthquake depth have a correlation to strength? 
How deep are most earthquakes and does location play a part in this?
